//state directory - represents everything that we need to implement for reducer to maintain data

//redux

//action creator - we refer to this event creator like event handles such button click, mouse hove etc...
//action - an object json {type : signinuser, payload : userObject} that contains, key value pair of actiontype (signin user) and payload (user object for user state)
//callback/reducer - a function which will generate new state for every action (action type), using the payload dispatched in action
//dispatch - we have a tightly coupled way of sending message to store for state update which passes through store by using dispatch method
//store - only one store is allowed in one application to maintain data, as one way flow

//react-redux
//this will provide us the access to store (redux) in react component, by using hooks or otherwise
// we need to bootstrap our application with react-redux Provider

//redux-thunk

//promise-middleware
